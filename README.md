This game is being developed with **BabylonJS**, **Node.js**, and **Blender**. BabylonJS is the game engine, Node.js the webserver, and Blender is being used for 3D modeling, texture mapping, and animations.

## Update 8/30/18 - AR Sandbox
I finished building an augmented reality sandbox that I plan on integrating into this game. Think of the Hunger Games scenes where the government officials are controlling the playfield using a holographic map.“Sandbox operators” will be able to modify the terrain of the battlefield, track player locations, place 3D printed markers to spawn hostile enemies, etc.

## v1.0a Release 7/4/18
This game is now in its alpha stage. It's playable, enjoyable, filled with bugs, and missing non-essential items.
