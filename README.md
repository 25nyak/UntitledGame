A work in progress! This will eventually be an online multiplayer arena type game... Think Mount and Blade, but with special abilities!

I'm using the Babylon.js library for the graphics and node.js + socket.io for the multiplayer components.

At its current state this game has basic movement, a character model, a few animations, and LAN multiplayer functionality. 

I'm new to game development and trying to do everything for this game (programming, textures, animations, 3D meshes), so development time will be rather long. However, I hope to have a server up and running with a playable version of the game by this winter.
