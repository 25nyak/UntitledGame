A work in progress! This will eventually be an online multiplayer arena type game... Think Mount and Blade, but with special abilities!

I'm using the **Babylon.js** library for the graphics and **node.js** + **socket.io** for the multiplayer components.

## v1.0a Release 7/4/18
This game is now in its alpha stage. It's playable, enjoyable, filled with bugs, and missing non-essential items.
